## Welcome

Thank you for visiting my personal website. I am a third year PhD student in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin. I currently work with Dr. Steven L. Finkelstein on high-redshift galaxies and the epoch of reionization using data from the [Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment](https://hetdex.org/)

For more information about my research, see my [research](/research) page or view my current [publications](/publications). If you are interested in receiving private tutoring for select undergraduate math, physics, and astronomy courses, more information is available on my [tutoring](/tutoring) page.
