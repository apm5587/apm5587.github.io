## Welcome

Thank you for visiting my personal website. I am a third year PhD student in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin. I currently work with Dr. Steven L. Finkelstein on high-redshift galaxies and the epoch of reionization using data from the [Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment](https://hetdex.org/)

For more information about my research, check out my [research](/research) page. You can also check out my [publications](/publications). If you are interested in tutoring for select math, physics, and astronomy courses, see my [tutoring](/tutoring) page.
