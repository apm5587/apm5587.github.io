title: About Me
---

I am from Downingtown, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia. I went to Penn State as an undergrad, and I'm loving my third year of living in Austin as a grad student! I enjoy many outdoor activities (so long as I'm slathered in sunscreen) like hiking, kayaking, swimming, and running, as well as less UV-intense activities, like reading, listening to music, and playing drum set and piano.
