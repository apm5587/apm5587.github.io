## Lyman-alpha Emitting Galaxies

Leveraging the HETDEX dataset, I studied the stellar population properties of a sample of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) between redshifts 1.9<z<3.5. I used spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques to constrain the posterior distributions for galaxies' masses, star formation rates, dust contents, and more within a Bayesian framework. Such a technique explores the full galaxy parameter space using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to find which parameters produce a spectral model best reflected by the observed data (in this case, from the Hubble Space Telescope). The pictures below show a model fit to the data as well as a "corner" plot showing the posterior distributions and their interdependencies.

My goal was to uncover exactly how these galaxy properties relate to the strength of Ly$\alpha$ emission, knowledge that could be invaluable for measuring the amount of neutral hydrogen in the epoch of reionization.
